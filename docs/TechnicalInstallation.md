# Installation (Technical Guide)

{:#intro .no_toc}

This guide outlines the steps required to deploy your
own instance of The Misinformation Game on Firebase.
At the end of this guide, you will have your own
website hosted at your own custom URL, (e.g.
https://misinformation-game.web.app).

This guide assumes that you have familiarity with installing
software and using the command line. If you are not familiar
with these processes, then the
[non-technical installation guide](/NonTechnicalInstallation)
may be easier to follow.

## 1. Installation of Required Dependencies

{:#install-dependencies}
Deployment of this project requires the use of
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install its dependencies.
A guide to install NPM can be found in the
[NPM Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once you have NPM installed, run the following commands to
download the source code of this project,

```shell
cd [path/to/download/project/into]
git clone https://github.com/TheMisinformationGame/MisinformationGame
cd MisinformationGame
```

In the above commands, replace `[path/to/download/project/into]`
with a path to where you want the source code of the project
to be downloaded on your computer. The source code will be
created as a new directory in that path, so `~/Documents` is
a sensible option (e.g. `cd ~/Documents`).

## 2. Firebase Initialisation

{:#firebase-initialisation}
You will now need to create your own Firebase project,
and link to it from the source code.

### 2.1. Set up your Firebase Project

{:#firebase-setup}

#### 2.1.1. Create Project

{:#firebase-create-project}
Navigate to the
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
at https://console.firebase.google.com/ to create your
project. Make sure that you have the correct Google account
selected in the top-right of the page.

Click the **Add Project** button to create a new Firebase
project. This will open a screen where you can choose a
name for your deployment of The Misinformation Game. The
URL of your website is configured below the Project
Name input (it is small). This URL will be shown to
participants of your studies. Therefore, you may wish to
choose an ambiguous name, so that participants are not
influenced by the URL.

<img src="diagrams/firebase-project-creation.png" alt="Example Firebase project creation" height="258" />

Once prompted, you should also disable Google Analytics,
and then continue. We do not make use of Google Analytics,
and therefore it is good to turn it off for the privacy
of users.

<img src="diagrams/disabling-analytics.png" alt="Disabling Google Analytics" height="174" />

Firebase will now take some time to generate your new project.
Wait until it is complete, and then select _Continue_. You
should now be redirected to the Firebase console for your
project.

<img src="diagrams/firebase-console.png" alt="Screenshot of the Firebase console" height="252" />

#### 2.1.2. Enable Firestore Database

{:#enable-firebase-firestore}
The Misinformation Game uses Firestore to store the
studies and their results, however it is not enabled
by default. To enable Firestore, navigate to
**Firestore Database** from your Firebase console and
click the **Create Database** button.

<img src="diagrams/creating-firestore-database-pt1.png" alt="Starting creation of Firestore database" height="250" />

You will next be prompted to select whether to create
the database in _Production_ or _Test_ mode. Make sure
that _Production Mode_ is selected, and then click
_Continue_.

<img src="diagrams/creating-firestore-database-pt2.png" alt="Creating Firestore database in production mode" height="295"/>

You will then be prompted to select a region to host the
database in. For best results, choose a region that is
close to where you and your participants will access the game.

<img src="diagrams/creating-firestore-database-pt3.png" alt="Selecting region for Firestore database" height="282" />

Your Firestore database should now be created! You should see
a screen like the one below.

<img src="diagrams/created-firestore-database.png" alt="Screen after creating Firestore database" height="242" />

#### 2.1.3. Enable Firebase Storage

{:#enable-firebase-storage}
Any images that are embedded within studies will be stored within
Firebase Storage. Therefore, Firebase Storage will need to be
enabled for your Firebase project. As of September 2024, you must have a Blaze pay-as-you-go account to set up storage.

**Step 1:** Select **Storage** under the **Build** tab on the left of the project page.  You will now be asked to set up default budget. Here, select "All locations" before continuing. You will be then asked again to set up security rules. Here, again select **Production Mode** before selecting create. Your storage should now be set up

<img src="diagrams/New_diagrams/storage-with-blaze-new.png" alt="figure 10" height="218" />

#### 2.1.4. Enable Google Authentication

{:#firebase-enable-google-auth}
The Misinformation Game uses Google accounts to
authenticate researchers so that only they can
access their studies. To enable Google Authentication,
navigate to **Authentication** in the Firebase console
and click the **Get started** button.

<img src="diagrams/enabling-auth-pt1.png" alt="Setting up authentication" height="218" />

You should now be shown several **Sign-in providers**.
Click on **Google** underneath **Additional providers**.

<img src="diagrams/enabling-auth-pt2.png" alt="Selecting Google authentication" height="341" />

You will now be shown a screen where you can setup the
Google Authentication. Toggle Google authentication to
enabled in the top-right. You should now be shown fields
to enter the public-facing name and email for your
project. This name and email will be shown to users who
sign up using the Google authentication. Once you have
entered your public-facing name and email, click _Save_.

<img src="diagrams/enabling-auth-pt3.png" alt="Setting up Google authentication" height="410" />

Firebase will now setup the Google authentication for
you, and then you should be redirected to a screen
that shows the Google authentication as _Enabled_.

<img src="diagrams/enabled-auth.png" alt="Screen after enabling Google authentication" height="122" />

### 2.2. Add a Web App to your Firebase Project

{:#firebase-add-web-app}
To connect the source code to your deployment, you must
create a Web App for your Firebase project. To do this,
navigate to the home-page of your Firebase project from
the console by selecting the _Project Overview_ button.
There should be an icon on the home-page that looks like
`</>` that you can click to create a new Web App.

<img src="diagrams/adding-web-app-pt1.png" alt="Adding a Web-App to your Firebase project" height="260" />

Once you have started the process to add a web app, you
should be shown a window titled _Add Firebase to your
web app_. Enter your project name, and select the checkbox
to set up Firebase Hosting. You can then click _Register app_
to continue to the next stage.

<img src="diagrams/adding-web-app-pt2.png" alt="Setting up Firebase hosting" height="225" />

You will now be shown several steps to set up the source
code of your Web App, however we have already done this
so all of these steps can be skipped. Just click _Next_
past the _Add Firebase SDK_ and _Install Firebase CLI_
steps. Finally, click _Continue to console_ to skip
deploying to Firebase. We will perform this step later.

### 2.3. Link your Web App in the Source Code

{:#firebase-link-web-app}
From the home-page of your Firebase console, navigate to
the project settings by selecting the cog wheel in the
top-left, and then **Project settings**.

<img src="diagrams/accessing-project-settings.png" alt="Accessing project settings" height="160" />

If you scroll down on the **Project settings** page, you
should be able to find information about your Web App.
You need to find the section titled **SDK setup and
configuration**, and select **Config**.

<img src="diagrams/accessing-web-app-config.png" alt="Accessing Web-App config" height="220" />

You should now be shown a code snippet containing
your Firebase configuration object. It should
look similar to the code snippet below.

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyDbBqOrit6Kj3FUsmI3i3AOOu27PLtkwTM",
  authDomain: "misinformation-game.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "misinformation-game",
  storageBucket: "misinformation-game.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "780788861427",
  appId: "1:780788861427:web:7f9b2b20c50e9b38cf6a86"
};
```

Your configuration object must be entered into the config file
`/config/firebase-config.js` in the source code. Navigate
to the source code that you downloaded in step 1. There
should be a directory named `config`, with a file
`firebase-config.js` inside. Open that file in a text
editor and replace the configuration object shown above
with your own configuration object from your Firebase console.
You should only need to replace the lines that look like the
code snippet above, and you should not edit anything else in
the file.

**Error if configuration is not set correctly:**

If you do not edit the config file correctly, then you will
not be able to sign in to your instance of The Misinformation
Game. If your configuration object is wrong, then you may be
shown the following error when signing in:

```
You could not be signed in:
This domain is not authorized to run this
operation. Add it to the OAuth redirect domains
list in the Firebase console -> Auth section ->
Sign in method tab.
```

### 2.4. Deploy to your Firebase Project

{:#deploy}
The Misinformation Game has the helper script
[deploy.sh](/deploy.sh) to help you to deploy to your
Firebase project. It can be run using the following
command from within the _MisinformationGame_ directory,

```shell
./deploy.sh
```

This script will take you through several steps to
install dependencies, initialise your project, and
deploy it to your live website.

#### 2.4.1. Installing Dependencies

{:#deploy-installing-dependencies}

```
==========================
Installing dependencies...
==========================
```

This step may take some time to install all the
dependencies of The Misinformation Game using
NPM.

#### 2.4.2. Installing Google Cloud SDK

{:#deploy-installing-google-cloud-sdk}

```
==================================
Installing the Google Cloud SDK...
==================================
```

This step will download and install the Google Cloud
SDK that will later be used to configure the CORS
settings for the storage of images in the app.

If you don't have Python 3 installed, you may be
prompted for your password so that the script can
automatically install Python 3 for you.

#### 2.4.3. Connect to Firebase

{:#deploy-connect-firebase}

```
=========================================================
Connecting to Firebase, you may be prompted to sign in...
=========================================================
```

This step will prompt you to log in to your Firebase
account, so that the Firebase project you created can
be accessed.

You may also be prompted to allow Firebase to collect
CLI usage and error reporting information. You can just
press the enter key to accept it, or you can type `n`
and the enter key to disable the analytics.

#### 2.4.4. Select Firebase Project

{:#deploy-select-firebase-project}

```
=================================================================
Please select the Firebase project you would like to deploy to...
=================================================================
```

This step will ask you to select the Firebase project
you created, so that we can deploy the website to the
project. Enter the number next to the name of your Firebase
project and press the _enter key_.

#### 2.4.5. Building the Application

{:#deploy-build}

```
echo "==========================="
echo "Building the application..."
echo "==========================="
```

This step will compile the application so that it
can be deployed. This step may take some time.

#### 2.4.6. Deploying to Firebase

{:#deploy-deploy}

```
========================================
Deploying the application to Firebase...
========================================
```

This step will deploy your application to your
Firebase project! After this step, you will be able
to access your website from its .web.app domain.
However, the game will not function correctly as
the website will not be able to load the avatars
of sources, or the images for posts.

#### 2.4.7. Initialise Google Cloud

{:#deploy-initialise-google-cloud}

```
============================
Initialising Google Cloud...
============================
```

This step will ask you to initialise the Google
Cloud SDK to point to your account and project.
You will be prompted for several inputs through
this process.

**Step 1:** You may be asked to pick a configuration
to use. If you are asked, then select the option to
`Re-initialize this coniguration`.

**Step 2:** You will be asked whether you
would like to log in. If you are already signed in,
you may select your account. Otherwise, press the
enter key to state that you would like to sign in.

**Step 3:** If you were not already signed in,
a browser should be opened where you can sign in
to the same account that you used for your Firebase
project. If your browser is not automatically opened,
there should be a URL in the terminal that you can
copy into a web-browser. When copying values from
the terminal, you will likely have to press the
shift key as well as the usual Cmd-C or Ctrl-C
keyboard shortcut. This is required, as most
terminals use the Cmd-C or Ctrl-C keyboard
shortcuts to exit the current program.

**Step 4:** You will next be asked to pick a cloud
project to use. Enter the number in square brackets
next to the name of your Firebase project.

#### 2.4.8. Uploading the CORS settings

{:#deploy-upload-cors-settings}

```
===============================================
Setting up the CORS settings for the website...
===============================================
```

This step will update the CORS settings of your
website so that the images for sources and posts
can be loaded. You will be prompted for your
project's .appspot.com domain. This domain is the
same as your .web.app domain, just with a different
extension. For example, for the example website for
this project, misinformation-game.web.app, you would
have to enter misinformation-game.firebasestorage.app.

#### 2.4.9. Complete!

{:#deploy-complete}

```
======================
Successfully Deployed!
======================
```

Your Firebase project should now be hosted at the URL
you set up in step 1!

## 3. Run your Studies!

{:#conclusion}

You should now have successfully deployed your own instance
of The Misinformation Game! However, before you can upload
studies, you will need to register your Google account as
an administrator. A guide to register users as administrators
can be found in the [Administrators](/Administrators) documentation.
I hope The Misinformation Game proves useful for your research!
