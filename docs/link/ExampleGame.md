# Example Game
{:#intro .no_toc}

The example game may be used to help to understand the basic functionality
and purpose of The Misinformation Game. The study configuration spreadsheet
that was used to create the example game can be found [here](/link/ExampleStudy).

<p class="info">
    If the game doesn't load correctly for you, then that may be caused due
    to hosting limits. The example game is hosted under the free tier of
    Firebase. You can read more about Firebase's limits and pricing in
    the <a href="/FirebasePricing">Firebase Pricing Documentation</a>.
