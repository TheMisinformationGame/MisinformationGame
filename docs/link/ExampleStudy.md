# Example Game Configuration Spreadsheets
{:#intro .no_toc}

The example games that are provided to demonstrate the Misinformation
Game were generated using the configuration spreadsheets provided
below. These configuration spreadsheets may be used as an example
to help understand the settings in the
[study configuration template spreadsheet](/link/StudyTemplate).
This spreadsheet is not always kept as up-to-date as the study configuration
spreadsheet, and therefore it should not be used as a basis to
create your own study (the study configuration template spreadsheet
should be used instead). More documentation on the spreadsheets can be
found in the [Study Configuration documentation](/StudyConfiguration).
