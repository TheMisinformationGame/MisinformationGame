# Documentation Development Environment
{:#intro .no_toc}

This document describes how to set up your development
environment to work on The Misinformation Game documentation
website, and host it locally for testing.


<!-- TODO: Split this into installation & running sections -->


## 1. Set ./docs as the Current Working Directory
{:#change-working-directory}

You must navigate your terminal to the ./docs directory
to run the documentation website. If you have cloned the
[themisinformationgame.github.io repository](https://github.com/TheMisinformationGame/themisinformationgame.github.io),
then this directory will not exist. Please clone the
[MisinformationGame repository](https://github.com/TheMisinformationGame/MisinformationGame)
instead. If your terminal's current working directory
is the MisinformationGame repository, then you may run the following
command to change it to the ./docs directory,

```shell
cd ./docs
```



## 2. Install Ruby Version 2.7
{:#install-ruby}

The documentation uses an old version of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
that is supported by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This
version of Jekyll requires [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) version 2.7
to run. This version is old. Therefore, the easiest way to install it
is to use [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/) (RVM).

Once you have installed RVM, you may use the following command to install
Ruby 2.7,

```shell
rvm install 2.7
```



## 3. Activate Ruby Version 2.7
{:#activate-ruby}

You can activate Ruby 2.7 so that it can be used by Jekyll using the following command,

```shell
rvm use 2.7
```



## 4. Install Jekyll Dependencies
{:#install-jekyll-dependencies}

You may now install GitHub Pages version of Jekyll, and its dependencies,
using the following command,

```shell
bundle install
```



## 5. Run Jekyll!
{:#run-jekyll}

You now have all the dependencies installed to run the development website!
The following command will start the documentation website locally, which
will automatically update if you change any of the files. Therefore, you will
only need to reload the page in your browser to see your changes,

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl="" --watch -o
```

Alternatively, if you have Ruby 2.7 active as described in the
[Activate Ruby Version 2.7 section](#activate-ruby), then you may also run the
documentation website with the following command from the root directory of
the repository,

```
npm run docs
```

If the documentation website doesn't open in your browser automatically,
then you can access it directly at [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).
